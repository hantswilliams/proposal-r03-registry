A. Significance

Cancer care generates some of the richest and most complex real-world data in medicine, yet oncology information is scattered across a patchwork of registries that rarely interoperate. Large, historic resources such as SEER, the National Cancer Database (NCDB), state tumor registries, payer claims warehouses, and innumerable institutional spreadsheets all encode overlapping variables with different definitions and update cadences. Most remain “batch-oriented” and file-based—SEER, for example, still distributes annual ASCII extracts and provides no modern API—while newer commercial oncology registries are paywalled and license-restricted. Even when registries adopt HL7® FHIR, they use divergent profiles, forcing researchers to write bespoke “extract–transform–load” scripts that fracture provenance and delay refreshes. The result is that community and rural oncology practices—where half of U.S. patients receive treatment—rarely contribute data to multi-site trials or AI training corpora, exacerbating disparities in evidence generation and limiting the external validity of precision-oncology insights.

The NIH Strategic Plan for Data Science (2025-2030) targets this fragmentation head-on. Goal 3 calls for “software tools that align with the FAIR principles and have a measurably enhanced user experience,” while Goal 4 envisions a federated biomedical data ecosystem that links repositories “rather than operate in isolation” and respects Tribal sovereignty. Goal 5 urges NIH to “strengthen a broad community in data science” by closing equity gaps through inclusive tooling. In direct response, the NIH Office of Data Science Strategy released RFA-OD-24-010, “Building Sustainable Software Tools for Open Science,” which demands open licensing, robust engineering, milestone-driven development, and free dissemination of software that accelerates biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research.

This project—FHIR-Native Open Registry & Knowledge Repository (FHIR-ORKR)—answers this call for oncology. FHIR-ORKR is an Apache-licensed, cloud-deployable platform that stores patient-level data natively as canonical FHIR R5 resources, with first-class support for the minimal Common Oncology Data Elements (mCODE) implementation guide and other evolving cancer-specific profiles. Data are exposed through modern REST and Bulk-FHIR APIs, while computable knowledge objects—clinical-quality-language phenotypes, outcome rules, and AI-ready feature stores—carry machine-actionable provenance (RO-Crate). By eliminating license fees and shrinking deployment time from months to hours, FHIR-ORKR will enable any oncology practice—especially community and safety-net sites—to participate in learning-health-system discovery. Immediate beneficiaries include investigators building multi-site cohorts, trialists needing real-time electronic case ascertainment, and algorithm developers seeking transparent, bias-aware oncology data. Long term, FHIR-ORKR will serve as a reference implementation for FAIR4RS-compliant, standards-native cancer registries, advancing NIH’s vision of a connected, federated, and equitable biomedical data ecosystem.
