A. Significance

Cancer generates some of the richest—and most fragmented—real-world data in medicine. Oncology information lives in an archipelago of registries: federal and state tumor registries such as SEER, hospital or EHR-vendor “enterprise” registries, payer claims warehouses, therapeutic-area consortia, and a growing number of patient-facing apps. These systems were built for different purposes—public-health surveillance, clinical quality improvement, product safety, or natural-history discovery—and therefore use non-aligned data models and vocabularies (s40290-020-00332-1). Even efforts that proclaim HL7® FHIR compliance often introduce bespoke profiles, forcing each importing site to engineer one-off extract–transform–load pipelines that fracture provenance and delay refresh cycles. Recent analyses of linked-registry projects show that semantic incompatibility and inadequate ontology mapping leave valuable datasets “wildly difficult to obtain or access,” perpetuating small, isolated silos (BioMed Research Interna) (s-0041-1724104). The situation is exacerbated by modern digital-health registries, where patients self-enter data through web portals or smartphones; while these sources capture patient-reported outcomes, they also lower verifiability and demand stronger provenance and quality controls (s40290-020-00332-1) (BioMed Research Interna). The net effect is a widening equity gap: community and rural oncology practices—where roughly half of U.S. patients receive therapy—rarely contribute data to multi-site studies or AI training corpora, limiting the external validity of precision-oncology findings.

The NIH Strategic Plan for Data Science 2025-2030 targets this fragmentation head-on. Goal 3 calls for FAIR, user-friendly software, Goal 4 envisions a federated infrastructure that links repositories “rather than operate in isolation,” and both goals emphasize lowering technical barriers for low-resource institutions and respecting Tribal data sovereignty (s-0041-1724104). RFA-OD-24-010, Building Sustainable Software Tools for Open Science, operationalizes these aims by requiring open licensing, robust engineering, and milestone-driven dissemination.

FHIR-Native Open Registry & Knowledge Repository (FHIR-ORKR) answers this call for oncology. The platform persists every datum—demographics, staging, genomic variants—as canonical FHIR R5 resources, with first-class support for the mCODE implementation guide and extensions for emerging cancer profiles. Modern REST and Bulk-FHIR APIs expose the data, while computable knowledge objects—clinical-quality-language phenotypes, outcome rules, AI feature stores—carry machine-actionable RO-Crate provenance. Delivered as Apache-licensed, containerized micro-services, FHIR-ORKR can be deployed by a safety-net clinic in hours and scaled in the cloud under NIH STRIDES credits. By eliminating license fees, harmonizing heterogeneous oncology data, and embedding FAIR4RS principles from the outset, FHIR-ORKR will let every oncology practice—not just well-funded centers—participate in learning-health-system discovery, enable cross-registry cohorts, and provide bias-aware training sets for trustworthy AI. In the long term, FHIR-ORKR will serve as a reference implementation for an equitable, federated cancer-data ecosystem, directly advancing NIH’s vision of connected, FAIR, and inclusive biomedical research.
