FHIR-ORKR introduces a set of tightly integrated advances that collectively redefine what an oncology registry can be while laying a template for other chronic-disease domains. First, it is truly native FHIR. Every data element—whether a tumor morphology code, genomic variant, or infusion administration record—is stored as a formally profiled FHIR R5 resource, with immediate support for the minimal Common Oncology Data Elements (mCODE) implementation guide. Because information is never shunted through fragile ETL pipelines, element-level provenance is preserved and sites can expose Bulk-FHIR export or SMART-on-FHIR apps the moment the platform is deployed.

Second, FHIR-ORKR elevates analytics artifacts to first-class, computable objects. Phenotype definitions, outcome rules, and AI feature vectors are versioned, citable, and wrapped in RO-Crate metadata, making advanced analyses—from recurrence-free–survival phenotypes to transformer-ready feature stores—instantly findable and reusable across institutions.

Third, sustainability is engineered from day one. The entire codebase is Apache-2.0 licensed, every tagged release mints a Zenodo DOI with a citation.cff record, and an automated software bill-of-materials, continuous security scans, and OpenSSF Scorecard badges operationalize NIH Best Practices for Sharing Research Software and FAIR4RS principles. Investigators can adopt, fork, or extend the platform without fear of vendor lock-in.

Fourth, federation is native to the architecture. Containerized micro-services (Docker + Helm/Terraform) deploy on any NIH STRIDES-eligible cloud or as an on-prem “sovereign node”—a critical requirement for Tribal, state, or European data-sovereignty constraints highlighted in the NIH Strategic Plan for Data Science. Built-in cross-registry OAuth and provenance chaining allow secure, low-latency federation without duplicating data.

These innovations make FHIR-ORKR the first production-grade, mCODE-aware, FAIR4RS-aligned oncology registry that is simultaneously standards-native, security-hardened, and freely adoptable. Although cancer provides the immediate use case, the same architecture can ingest additional implementation guides—such as cardiac eMERGE, IPS, or chronic-kidney-disease profiles—positioning the platform as a reusable foundation for learning-health-system research across a broad spectrum of chronic diseases.
