B. Innovation

Oncology registries today mirror the fragmentation seen across the broader registry landscape: frameworks differ by purpose—public-health surveillance, product safety, natural history—each with proprietary schemas and vocabularies that defeat cross-study linkage . Attempts to knit these silos together routinely stall on semantic incompatibility and missing ontology mappings, leaving “wildly difficult to obtain or access” datasets isolated from one another . FHIR-ORKR confronts those barriers with four intertwined advances that, taken together, redefine what an oncology registry can be and create a template for other chronic-disease domains.

First, truly native FHIR persistence. Every datum—tumor morphology, genomic variant, infusion administration—is stored as a formally profiled FHIR R5 resource, immediately compatible with the minimal Common Oncology Data Elements (mCODE) guide. Because information is never shunted through brittle ETL pipelines, element-level provenance is preserved and sites can expose Bulk-FHIR export or SMART-on-FHIR apps on day one, eliminating months of custom mapping work that currently hobbles registries such as SEER or NCDB.

Second, analytics objects are promoted to computable, shareable assets. Phenotype definitions, outcome rules, and AI feature vectors are packaged as versioned knowledge objects wrapped in RO-Crate metadata. This semantic layer echoes the rare-disease “linked registries” approach—using ontologies and provenance to create a holistic view across heterogeneous stores —but implements it natively inside a standards-based cancer registry, making recurrence-free-survival phenotypes or transformer-ready feature stores instantly discoverable and reusable across institutions.

Third, sustainability is engineered in from the outset. The entire codebase is Apache-2.0 licensed; each tagged release mints a Zenodo DOI and includes a citation.cff file, ensuring credit and traceability in line with NIH Best Practices for Sharing Research Software (s40290-020-00332-1). Automated SBOM generation, continuous security scans, and OpenSSF Scorecard badges embed FAIR4RS and software-supply-chain principles directly into the development lifecycle, avoiding the long-term maintenance crises reported for many disease-specific registries (BioMed Research Interna).

Fourth, federation is native—not an after-thought bolt-on. Containerised micro-services (Docker + Helm/Terraform) deploy on any NIH STRIDES-eligible cloud or as an on-prem “sovereign node,” satisfying data-sovereignty constraints highlighted in the NIH Data Science Plan. Built-in cross-registry OAuth, vocabulary services, and provenance chaining allow secure, low-latency federation without data duplication, operationalising the semantic-web vision proposed for rare-disease registries (Best Practices for Shar) (marshall-et-al-2016-the).

Together these innovations yield the first production-grade, mCODE-aware, FAIR4RS-aligned oncology registry that is simultaneously standards-native, security-hardened, and freely adoptable. Although cancer is the immediate use-case, the architecture is agnostic to disease-specific implementation guides; integrating mature profiles such as those used by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry can be accomplished by adding new FHIR packages and ontology bindings, extending the platform seamlessly to other chronic conditions (BioMed Research Interna) (marshall-et-al-2016-the).
