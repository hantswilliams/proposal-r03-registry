C. Approach

C.1 Overall strategy. As the sole PD/PI, I will direct all scientific and technical work, contracting specific DevOps and usability tasks on an hourly basis. Development will proceed in two-week agile sprints with continuous integration; each sprint publishes a public release, a Syft SBOM, and an automated benchmark report that includes Synthea-Oncology synthetic bundles. A quarterly review by an external advisory board—drawn from HL7® FHIR, the NIH Office of Data Science Strategy (ODSS), and a patient-advocate representative—satisfies RFA requirements for “robust software-development plans and metrics.”

C.2 Aim 1 — Architect and implement the FHIR data & terminology layer (Months 0–9).
I will author an institution-agnostic Implementation Guide that profiles Patient, Encounter, Observation, Condition, Procedure, and Medication resources and embeds the minimal Common Oncology Data Elements (mCODE) plus bindings to SNOMED CT, LOINC, RxNorm, ICD-O-3, and OncoTree. Continuous validation with the Inferno+ test harness will use both Synthea-Oncology bundles and real pilot data. Success is defined as ≥ 95 % conformance and an open-access IG DOI by Month 9. Terminology gaps will be handled through extensions that retain original codes with full provenance.

C.3 Aim 2 — Build and harden the open-source registry & knowledge repository (Months 6–18).
Under my supervision, contracted DevOps engineers will package Spring-Boot micro-services in Docker, orchestrate them with Helm, and secure them via SMART-on-FHIR OAuth 2.0 with attribute-based access control. A GraphQL façade will support modern oncology applications such as molecular-tumor-board viewers. The knowledge layer will store computable phenotypes in a Blazegraph triple-store and execute them with a CQL engine; each derived dataset will be stamped by a FHIR Provenance resource and wrapped in an RO-Crate manifest. CI pipelines enforce ≥ 90 % unit-test coverage, nightly OWASP ZAP scans, and an OpenSSF Scorecard “passing” badge. A CoreTrustSeal self-audit will document curation policies, authentication, versioning, and disaster recovery.

C.4 Aim 3 — Demonstrate value, generalizability, and sustainability (Months 15–24).
A community oncology practice and an NCI-designated academic center will deploy FHIR-ORKR on STRIDES-supported AWS and Azure tenants, respectively, ingesting ≥ 50 000 de-identified records—including mCODE-conformant subsets. Pilot workflows will calculate recurrence-free survival and detect immune-related adverse events; Year-2 stretch goals include adapting the same pipeline to chronic kidney disease (CKD) phenotypes. Monthly community calls, a contributor covenant, and a governance charter modeled on the Cloud-Native Computing Foundation’s maintainer ladder will anchor sustainability. Success metrics are ≥ 1 000 external API calls per month, ≥ 2 merged community pull requests, and a CoreTrustSeal-ready manual by Month 24.

C.5 Evaluation and risk management.
Latency, throughput, security-scan scores, and adoption metrics stream to a public dashboard. Risks and mitigations: (i) FHIR or mCODE version drift—blocked by CI tests against new HL7 and OncoTree releases; (ii) cloud-egress costs—mitigated via in-place federated Spark queries and delta encoding; (iii) community attrition—countered with mini-grants, hackathons, and rapid publication in JOSS.

C.6 Data and software sharing plan.
Code, Helm charts, and docs will be released on GitHub under Apache 2.0; each tag mints a Zenodo DOI with a citation.cff. A de-identified mCODE extract from pilot sites will be deposited in the NCI Cancer Research Data Commons (controlled access) and a synthetic oncology dataset in a generalist FAIR repository. This approach meets NIH Data Management and Sharing rules and the RFA mandate that software remain “freely available.”

C.7 Team, environment, timeline, and budget.
I will devote 30 % effort to lead the project. Contracted DevOps and UX specialists (0.6 FTE combined) and a part-time terminology curator (0.2 FTE) will execute scoped tasks. Institutional DevSecOps staff and STRIDES credits supply infrastructure. Direct costs: $300 000 (Year 1 $200 000; Year 2 $100 000), covering personnel, cloud services, CoreTrustSeal fees, and the RFA-mandated ODSS software-tools meeting. Gantt allocation: Quarters 1–2 for IG and API construction; Quarters 3–4 for platform hardening; Quarters 5–6 for pilot deployment and governance.
