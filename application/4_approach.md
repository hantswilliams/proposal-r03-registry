C. Approach

C.1 Overall strategy and current proof-of-concept.
During preliminary work I built a non-production MVP registry that proves end-to-end feasibility. The prototype, documented in the Technology Summary, uses Python/Flask-RESTX with Pydantic validation to accept JSON payloads, persists transactions in PostgreSQL, synchronises canonical resources to a co-located HAPI-FHIR server via Celery tasks, and presents a Next.js/TypeScript dashboard. JWT-secured endpoints already create, read, and update Patient, Condition, Observation, and Procedure resources, and automated tests run in GitHub Actions. This “starter kit” ingests Synthea-Oncology bundles and confirms that commodity, licence-free components can ingest, validate, and render FHIR objects in minutes on a laptop.

The proposed project converts that proof-of-concept into a production-grade, standards-native platform. Key gaps to be addressed are (i) upgrading resource models to full FHIR R5 with mCODE extensions; (ii) adding Bulk-FHIR $export and GraphQL façades; (iii) hardening security (OAuth 2.0 / ABAC) and supply-chain integrity (SBOM, OpenSSF Scorecard); (iv) implementing a provenance-rich knowledge layer (Blazegraph + CQL + RO-Crate); and (v) packaging everything as Helm charts that can run on any STRIDES-eligible cloud or on-prem “sovereign” node.

## Stage 1 – Data & Terminology Foundation (Month 0 – 9).
The first stage hardens the proof-of-concept into a standards-compliant data layer. I will port the MVP’s R4 resources to FHIR R5, deploy a dedicated HAPI-FHIR R5 server, and author an institution-agnostic Implementation Guide (IG). Using FHIR Shorthand, I will profile Patient, Encounter, Observation, Condition, Procedure, and Medication and embed the full mCODE specification, binding every element to SNOMED CT, LOINC, RxNorm, ICD-O-3, and OncoTree. Continuous-integration fixtures include 250 Synthea-Oncology bundles and 500 de-identified UVA Cancer Brain-Metastasis cases supplied under an IRB-approved data-use agreement. Each pull request must clear the Inferno+ test harness at ≥ 95 % before merging. When the IG, JSON-Schema, and example bundles are published on Zenodo with a DOI, Stage 1 is complete and the project owns a freely distributable, ontology-rich schema that any site can adopt.

## Stage 2 – Platform & Knowledge Services (Month 6 – 18).
While Stage 1 finishes, Stage 2 stands up the production stack. Contract DevOps engineers will containerise the Flask validator, Spring-Boot API gateway, HAPI-FHIR server, Blazegraph triple-store, and a Next.js client, then orchestrate them with Helm for Kubernetes. Security moves from MVP JWT tokens to Keycloak-backed SMART-on-FHIR OAuth 2.0 with role-based and attribute-based access controls. A GraphQL façade (Apollo Gateway) will federate REST calls and SPARQL queries, exposing a single tumorBoardCase(id) resolver for downstream apps. Computable knowledge objects—phenotypes written in CQL, outcome rules, and AI feature manifests—will live in Blazegraph and be packaged with RO-Crate metadata. The DevSecOps pipeline adds SBOM generation (Syft), CVE scanning (Grype), nightly OWASP ZAP tests, and an OpenSSF Scorecard badge. Stage 2 ends with an initial CoreTrustSeal self-audit and performance proof: a 1 million-record synthetic cohort yields < 2-second query latency on a STRIDES-sized cluster.

## Stage 3 – Deployment, Demonstration & Sustainability (Month 15 – 24).
In the final stage a community oncology practice and an NCI-designated academic centre will deploy FHIR-ORKR via Terraform modules on AWS EKS and Azure AKS, respectively. Each site will load ≥ 50 000 de-identified cancer encounters and run turnkey analyses that compute recurrence-free survival and detect immune-related adverse events. A stretch objective reuses the same pipeline to calculate eGFR trends in chronic kidney disease, demonstrating disease-agnostic extensibility. Monthly office hours, mini-grant calls, and a governance charter based on the Cloud-Native CNCF maintainer ladder will cultivate an open-source community. Success is measured by ≥ 1 000 external API calls per month, at least two outside pull requests merged, and a CoreTrustSeal-ready operations manual.

C.5 Evaluation and risk management. Latency, throughput, vulnerability-scan scores, and adoption metrics will stream continuously to a public Grafana dashboard. Version drift in FHIR or mCODE will be caught by automated CI tests against each new HL7® and OncoTree release; cloud-egress costs will be controlled by optional in-place Spark queries with delta encoding; potential community attrition will be mitigated through mini-grants, hackathons, and rapid publication in JOSS to sustain contributor enthusiasm.

C.6 Data and software sharing. All code, Helm charts, and documentation will be released on GitHub under the Apache 2.0 licence; every tagged release will mint a Zenodo DOI and include a citation.cff file. A de-identified mCODE extract from the pilot sites will be deposited in the NCI Cancer Research Data Commons under controlled access, and a fully synthetic oncology dataset will be published in a FAIR generalist repository, satisfying NIH Data-Management-and-Sharing requirements and the RFA mandate that software remain freely available.

C.7 Team, environment, and budget. I will devote 30 percent effort to direct the project. Hourly DevOps and UX specialists (0.6 FTE combined) and a 0.2 FTE terminology curator will execute scoped tasks. Institutional DevSecOps support and NIH STRIDES cloud credits provide infrastructure. Direct costs total $300 000—$200 000 in Year 1 and $100 000 in Year 2—including personnel, cloud fees, CoreTrustSeal expenses, and travel to the ODSS software-tools meeting.
