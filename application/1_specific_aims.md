SPECIFIC AIMS

Proprietary clinical registries—whether vendor-hosted oncology platforms, hospital-built dashboards, or direct-to-patient “digital binders”—have become the primary means of aggregating longitudinal cancer data, yet they remain technological silos. Records are stored in idiosyncratic schemas, exported as flat files only once or twice a year, and locked behind licence fees that safety-net and rural practices cannot afford. Even registries advertised as “FHIR-enabled” usually bolt a thin API onto a legacy database and still depend on brittle extract–transform–load (ETL) scripts that fracture provenance and delay discovery. Consequently, multi-site studies are difficult to reproduce, pragmatic trials accrue slowly, and AI training corpora inherit bias. A truly native-FHIR, FAIR-compliant registry—capable of ingesting domain guides such as the minimal Common Oncology Data Elements (mCODE), free of licence fees, and simple enough for small practices to deploy—is urgently needed.

I propose to create FHIR-Native Open Registry & Knowledge Repository (FHIR-ORKR)—an Apache-licensed, cloud-hosted toolkit that ingests patient-level data as canonical FHIR R5 resources (including mCODE-conformant oncology records), exposes them through modern REST and Bulk-FHIR APIs, and layers computable knowledge objects (phenotypes, outcome rules, AI feature stores) with machine-actionable provenance. FHIR-ORKR squarely addresses RFA-OD-24-010 “Building Sustainable Software Tools for Open Science” and advances Goals 3 (FAIR, sustainable software) and 4 (federated infrastructure) of the NIH Strategic Plan for Data Science 2025-2030. Where specialised expertise is required—DevOps hardening, usability testing, or terminology curation—I will supervise short-term contractors.

Central hypothesis. A rigorously engineered, standards-native, open-source registry will (i) reduce the cost and time required to establish interoperable data infrastructure, (ii) broaden research participation by under-resourced oncology sites, and (iii) accelerate trustworthy AI/ML development through first-class provenance and computable metadata. I will test this hypothesis through three aims:

| **Aim**                                                                   | **Approach & Deliverables**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | **Primary Outcome**                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1 – Architect and implement the FHIR-native data & terminology layer**  | • Profile *Patient, Encounter, Observation, Condition, Medication,* and *Procedure* resources and embed mCODE.<br>• Bind SNOMED CT, LOINC, RxNorm, ICD-O-3, and OncoTree.<br>• Release schema, JSON-Schema validations, and Inferno+ test harness in a public GitHub repo. | ≥ 95 % pass rate on Inferno+ (incl. mCODE bundles); schema DOI minted on Zenodo                               |
| **2 – Build and harden the cloud-hosted registry & knowledge repository** | • Containerise micro-services (Docker/Helm), automate CI/CD, publish SBOM.<br>• Implement knowledge layer for CQL phenotypes, outcome rules, and AI feature vectors with RO-Crate provenance.                                                                              | End-to-end ingest → query latency < 2 s for a 1 M-record synthetic cohort; OpenSSF Scorecard “passing”        |
| **3 – Demonstrate value, generalisability, and sustainability**           | • Deploy FHIR-ORKR on a STRIDES-eligible cloud at one partner oncology site; ingest ≥ 5 000 de-identified records, including mCODE subsets.<br>• Establish governance charter, contributor guidelines, and community roadmap; disseminate via *JOSS* and webinars.         | ≥ 1 000 external API calls / month, ≥ 2 merged community pull requests, CoreTrustSeal-ready operations manual |


Expected impact. FHIR-ORKR will become the first production-grade, mCODE-aware, FAIR4RS-aligned oncology registry that any institution can deploy or query freely. By eliminating proprietary barriers and embedding NIH best practices for sustainable open-science software, the project will democratise real-world oncology data, catalyse multi-site studies, and supply a transparent substrate for reproducible AI in cancer research—while providing an extensible template for other chronic-disease domains.
